I just got sent your names and emails, and I've quickly set up this site we can use. I'll post communication, resources, and other things here. For a brief introduction about me, click [here](@/welcome.md). I'll contact you later with more info, as I need to sleep now. I'll be moving in tomorrow.
<!-- more -->

For now, I'd appreciate if you respond to my email letting me know you've read up to here, and I'd appreciate if you'd introduce yourself. However, you don't need to yet, as I only want to use as much time as you want to spend on this mentorship. I don't know the requirements by the program, but I only expect you meet those, and anything else I see as extra that should benefit you. I'd also appreciate you sending over your preferred form of contact (email, number, socials, etc.). I'm flexible and open to whatever works best for you.

In summary, please send a acknowledgement response, an optional introduction, and your contact info (however best suits you).

I look forward to the coming year, and I hope I can impart some wisdom, however little I have.
