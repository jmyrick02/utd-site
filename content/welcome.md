Hello UTD, I'm Jack! I am an undergraduate studying computer science and mathematics in my senior year. I've interned at Amazon and Noblis as a software development engineer. I've also done research that has been submitted to and rejected by a couple of conferences :)

I primarily made this site for my two freshmen mentees studying computer science, but anyone's welcome to reach out to me at jam200020@utdallas.edu.

If you're curious on how it's made, I used [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator that I noticed my former professor [Emily Fox](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~emily.fox/) used. I'm using the [after-dark](https://www.getzola.org/themes/after-dark/) theme, though I may change it.
