Hello mentees, I decided I'd send an update to both of you since I think it'd be relevant to both of you. I wanted to link a resource related to competitive programming/LeetCode called Advent of Code, and recommend both of you participate this winter (I know one of you already has participated in this, just a reminder). I've also included my schedule for my four years at UTD since I know both of you are interested in either a double major or a minor in mathematics.
<!-- more -->

The first resource is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I highly recommend participating in a language you wish to get more experience in. Many people try a new language every year. There are new problems every day, and it's a great training ground.

Next up is my 4-year schedule. This is my personal document I've augmented with a difficulty rating (1-5 with 5 being the most difficult/most work). Note that these difficulty ratings are professor dependent, and we all have different strengths and weaknesses so YMMV. The numbers next to each semester heading are the total credit hours taken. Hopefully this helps you in deciding classes and planning your 4-year plan. I highly recommend having a fleshed out 4-year plan.

Overall, I am happy with this plan, but I would do two things differently. First, I would take Analysis I and II my Junior year so I could take Topology after Analysis. Next, I wouldn't take Professor Maweu for Software Engineering. I also would try to avoid Professor Koshevnik for Probability. I would also avoid Professor Dollinger for CS2.

CS + Math 4 year plan:
